Today we printed out 3D mountains that we chose on the website terrain2stl. I chose Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania because it is mentioned in a song I really like: Africa by Toto. The coordinates of Mount Kilimanjaro are 3.0674° S, 37.3556° E, but to position the box that determined what would be converted to an STL, I just dragged it over to the moutain's location on the map. The way that the website works is that you select a certain area of land by placing the red box over it, then it takes the topography of that land and converts into an STL file that has the same proportions as real life. The dimensions of the print were 63.5mm x 88.90mm x 25.4mm which I was able to obtain by changing the scaling factors in Bambu. This is what the design looked like in Bambu before printing:

This is the final, printed design:
