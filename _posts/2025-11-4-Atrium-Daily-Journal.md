Today we had our first meeting with the rest of the people that will be helping with the Fablab Rehab collaboration with Pearl. The goal of the meeting was to communicate to them Scarlett, Karlin, Marisol, and I’s positions of leadership as well as their roles coming forward. To determine their roles, we sent out a google form where they could submit however much experience they have with basic things like 3D printing, laser cutting, soldering, up to more advanced tasks like milling and using Fusion360 and divided them into four groups: no experience, novice, intermediate, and advanced. We are going to make the groups so that people can do tasks that they are good at and for the people who have little to no experience, we will host training sessions before and after school to teach them engineering skills. This project involves a lot of printing out designs and making small changes to designs in Fusion 360, which would take entirely too long if it was just the four leaders working on the project, so it will cut down a lot of time and increase our efficiency to have these underclassmen helping.

Since my job is to manage correspondence between Atrium/ the Pearl and CLS, I drafted an email today to achieve these goals: 
Update of where we are
Tell them about how we're going to have more students for the spring
Underclassmen are getting involved to help us increase our capabilities of improving things
How can we schedule something in the future - are saturdays possible
How can we start exploring what other internships and opportunities are available with Pearl
In the email I described our progress with the donning tubes and quad sticks as well as described the benefits of having a group of underclassmen work on the project. I also asked about times that we could go in to meet with them in the future. Lastly, I asked about the future opportunities we may receive from Atrium and the Pearl through internships or shadowing experiences.
