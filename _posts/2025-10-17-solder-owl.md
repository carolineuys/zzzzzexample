The second project we have done in-class was a small soldering refresher with a touch-interactive owl kit. The only problem I ran into during this project was that some of the soldering connections were not always sticking to the pads, especially the ones for the usb-c port. To correct this issue I made sure to take my time with the soldering and add extra solder where it was needed. Below are pictures documenting my progress throughout doing the soldering kit and the final product:
