# Welcome to Jekyll!
#
# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  bio    : "My name is Caroline Uys and I am a senior at Charlotte Latin School. I am currently 17 years old and I hope to study biomedical engineering in college. My interest in BME was sparked by my love for biology and engineering during my junior year in highschool. I am also really interested in neuroscience and neuroengineering because I think the brain is a field that lacks a lot of information. My year-long project for this class is a joint effort with other people in my class to help design and improve assistive technology devices for the patients in the Atrium Carolina's Rehabilitation Center (The Pearl) and can be found at this link: https://github.com/26wickhm/pearl"
